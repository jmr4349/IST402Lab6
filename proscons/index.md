# Pros and Cons

Every single CMS has pros and cons that are associated with it. 

## Pros

* Easy to Implement
* Markdown Based Pages
* Free!

## Cons

* Doesn't Allow for more Complexity


Docsify is easy to implement due to its simple nature. Anyone can make markdown files, and if you don't one google search and you'll find what you need. Docsify is also free! Which is a huge plus, because paying money that you shouldn't have to is never good. However, Docsify doesn't get more complex than this, and if you want more to web pages theb you should start looking somewhere else. Docsify is at its strongest when its just used for documentation.
