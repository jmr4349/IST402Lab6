# Alternatives

There are many other alternatives to Docsify that you might want to use just in case this isn't what you're looking for. 

## VuePress

[VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) is another markdown based documentation site generator. It can similalry be hosted on gitpages for easy implementation. If you don't like how Docsify does thing=s try this one out for sure!

## MKDocs

[MKDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) is another documentation static website generator that can also be hosted on gitpages. This is primaraly done through Pyhton, so if Python is more up to your speed than be sure to check this one out!

## GitBook

[GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/) is a documentation generator that is affiliated with GitHub. GitBook has a great UI for documentation, without having to even open a markdown file. 

If you are not a fan on the way Docsify does things then there are still many great options for creating static webpages that are safe to have up and running. All of these posibilities are great for documentation, or just whatever you want.
